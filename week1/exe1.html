    <p>
        My name is Chai Ke Qi, nickname is Kiki and I am 18 years old. I was born and raised in Johor,Segamat.
        Currently,
        I am a student at Dasein Academy of Art majoring in Digital Media. I have a great passion for
        design,photography,
        makeup, beauty, singing and watching dramas. In my free time, I enjoy watching dramas,creating digital art.
        These
        activities help me relax and improve my creativity. Besides that, I love exploring different types of food,
        especially Malaysian cuisine. From nasi lemak to Char Kuey Teow, I enjoy trying different flavors and learning
        about
        their history. In my free time, I also like cooking, taking food photos, and sharing my food experiences with
        others.</p>


    <p>
        I am skilled in graphic design, video editing, problem-solving, and I always strive to improve myself. I
        consider
        myself creative, detail-oriented, confidence, and bravery which helps me perform well in both academic and
        personal
        projects.In the future, I hope to explore more food cultures, learn how to cook traditional dishes, and use
        design
        to create content about Malaysian food. My goal is to help more people appreciate the beauty of food and culture
        through creative visuals and storytelling.
    </p>

    <p>I believe that every experience shapes who we are, and I am excited to continue my journey of learning and
        self-improvement. Food connects people, and I love sharing my passion through design and creativity.</p>

    <p><strong>Thank you for getting to know me!</strong></p>
