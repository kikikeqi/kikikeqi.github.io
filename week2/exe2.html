    <h1>CHAI KE QI</h1>
    <h2>“I am not lazy, I am on energy-saving mode.”</h2>
    <p>My name is Chai Ke Qi, nickname is Kiki and I am 18 years old. I was born and raised in Johor, Segamat.
        Currently,I am a student at Dasein Academy of Art majoring in Digital Media. I have a great passion for
        design,photography,makeup, beauty, singing and watching dramas. In my free time, I enjoy watching
        dramas,creating digital art.
    </p>


    <p>These activities help me relax and improve my creativity. Besides that, I love exploring different types of
        food, especially Malaysian cuisine. From nasi lemak to Char Kuey Teow, I enjoy trying different flavors and
        learning about their history. In my free time, I also like cooking, taking food photos, and sharing my food
        experiences with others.
